a card game

Python code
python3 -m http.server 5500


Bug list: 
* Harbinger - Sometimes Harbinger's button says Discard
* Vassal - the Action card I draw does not get its effects applied
* Turn counter is missing its colon
* Randomize gold+VP at first hand
* Masquerade - button says Trash / Discard Selected when it shouldn't, e.g. after a card with a modal is played on a previous hand, like Cellar
* Masquerade - the card you don't choose gets lost somewhere (trashed? abandoned?)
* Cellar and Chapel don't show up in my game inventory
* Chapel gets trashed when you use it??

To-do
* Restyle 
* Add win conditions
